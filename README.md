i was unable to complete the project within time but i have tried my best and also i have potential to do better than this.
I don't know about pycharm so it took too much time to complete the setup after that i aslo dont know how to use the pycharm and how am i supposed to create the project this is totally time consuming process. And after i have installed Django in pycharm with the help of PIP. 
Then i have created the "templetes" Repository beacuse in pycharm it will this repository first then remaining ones.In this repository i have create a "home.html" file so i could write html code in it.
i have tried simple program to display the word hii using "HttpRespose" method and it worked. for this i have used "path" & "Views" package.
Then i move to next method is "Render" this method took more time than pervious mrthod.
After that i have created "Sign up" and "Login "form using html css code .
I was unable to complete backend part that is databasd creation and connectivity of database because Django is new to me and i am not able connect mysql server and pycharm in the given time.
I will look forward to proper guidance from experts.
