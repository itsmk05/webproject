Welcome to my Demo project . i have installed pycharm in my system And after i have installed Django in pycharm with the help of PIP. 
Then i have created the "templetes" Repository beacuse in pycharm it will this repository first then remaining ones.In this repository i have create a "home.html" file so i could write html code in it.
i have tried simple program to display the word hii using "HttpRespose" method and it worked. for this i have used "path" & "Views" package.
Then i move to next method is "Render" this method took more time than pervious mrthod. and in this project i have used render method.
After that i have created "Sign up" and "Login "Page using html css code .
I was unable to complete backend part that is databasd creation and connectivity of database because Django is new to me and i am not able connect mysql server and pycharm in the given time.
I will look forward to proper guidance from experts.
